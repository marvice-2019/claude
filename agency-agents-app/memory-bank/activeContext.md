# Active Context — Agency Agents

**State (2026-09-15)**: **v0.3.1 is cut and validated; only the Mac DMGs remain.** `main` @ `32641d5`, eight commits
past `e8f3fcd`. The release candidate is PR #104 (`feat/approved-icon-family`) — Linux and Windows CI both green on
its exact head — carrying the icon family, the landing favicon fix and the version bump. The queue is down from 16
open PRs to 10 and from 16 issues to 11. What is left is `scripts/release.sh` on this machine (Developer ID +
notarisation come from the Keychain, so Mac builds cannot come from CI), then the tag, the release, and the cask's
`version`/`sha256`, which can only be computed once the DMGs exist.

**Landed 2026-09-14 — the release push.** Seven PRs verified *together* in a throwaway worktree before any of them
touched `main` (279 Rust tests, `svelte-check` 322 files / 0 errors), then merged in order: #95 `brew trust` in the
README, #69 embed the WebView2 bootstrapper, #77 correct `TAURI_CONFIG` for the CLI, #85 no Windows console flashes,
#99 AppArmor unconfined for the Linux release container, #98 in-range dependency bumps, #101 Turkish localisation.
Issues #96, #87 and #84 closed; **#65 deliberately left open** — #69 is a strong candidate but nobody has reproduced
it on a clean Windows box, and closing on reasoning alone would be claiming a fix we have not demonstrated.

**#77 broke the Windows build, and nothing caught it.** `tools/tauri-run.mjs` spawns `tauri` from PATH; on Windows
the npm shim is `tauri.cmd`, which Node refuses to exec without `shell: true` — and `shell: true` would then mangle
the JSON `--config` through cmd.exe quoting. Fixed in #105 by resolving `@tauri-apps/cli/tauri.js` and running it
with `process.execPath`: no shim, no shell, no quoting layer. It was merged having been verified only on macOS, and
surfaced only because a Windows build was dispatched against the RC branch. **This repo still has no PR CI** — the
`pr-check.yml` draft (svelte-check + `cargo test`, deliberately without `cargo fmt --check` until #100 lands) would
have caught it, and has now earned its place.

**#94 is proven at runtime, not inferred.** An x86_64 Ubuntu 24.04 guest (QEMU under the ARM Scratch VM) ran the
jammy-built AppImage — a genuinely foreign host. The app's own environment carries eleven bundle dirs in
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; the `git` child it spawned has `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` and
`GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE` gone, `XDG_DATA_DIRS` reduced to the host's `/usr/share`, and `APPDIR` deliberately intact.
No `nghttp2` error. **A harness lesson came with it**: the first capture read empty and proved nothing —
`tr '\0' … < /proc/self/environ` opens the proc file before `execve`, so the read returns nothing after exec.
`cat /proc/self/environ | tr` works. Always prove a fixture can show the failure before trusting its silence.

**Two live bugs found and not yet fixed.**
- **`PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONPATH` leak into AppImage children** — the same class as #94 at different variables, and the
  sanitiser does not cover them. The bundle contains no Python (`usr/bin` holds exactly `agency-agents-app` and
  `xdg-open`), so a Python child dies with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'`. **`aider` is a
  pip-installed CLI and one of the fifteen binaries `probe_version` spawns**, so every AppImage install reports it as
  absent when it is present. Demonstrated with a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` stand-in: rc=0 on the host, rc=1 under the
  environment the AppImage hands its children. Two entries fix it — `PYTHONPATH` into `PATH_LIST_VARS`, `PYTHONHOME`
  into `BUNDLE_ONLY_VARS`. Note `PERLLIB` is already covered; Python was simply missed.
- **The Tauri CLI rewrites `Cargo.toml` on every macOS build**, adding `macos-private-api` to the *base*
  `[dependencies]`. `main` keeps it correctly scoped under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]`.
  Committing the generated form ships a macOS-only feature to Linux and Windows, whose resolved config never carries
  `macOSPrivateApi`, reproducing the allowlist failure as red CI. It bit three times in one day. A pre-commit guard
  rejecting the base-dependency form would make it unshippable by accident.

**Windows build box (Parallels ARM64), provisioned 2026-09-14.** From nothing but git and the SDK: VS Build Tools at
`C:\BuildTools` (Hostarm64 → arm64/x64/x86), SDK 10.0.26100, Rust 1.98.1 with both MSVC targets, Node 22.20. It
**compiles** both architectures natively in ~3 min each (v0.3.1, PE `0xAA64` and `0x8664`) but **cannot package**:
NSIS's `makensis.exe` is 32-bit and exits `0xC0000135` (DLL not found) with every candidate ruled out — x86 emulation
works, `zlib1.dll` is x86, `MSVCP60.dll` is present, the x86 VC++ redistributable changed nothing. WiX fails the same
way, so `bundle.targets: "all"` is effectively **x64-only on Windows**. Packaging stays with CI. Two facts worth the
docs: the build needs **clang** (the VC workload omits it; CI only works because the runner image ships LLVM), and
`--bundles nsis` is required on any ARM64 Windows host.

**The icon family (PR #104).** The mark filled 71.3% of the canvas and was off-centre — measured from the masters its
bbox is `(179,162)-(875,892)`, centre `(527,527)` not `(512,512)`. One wrapper per layer,
`translate(512,512) scale(1.12) translate(-527,-527)`, no path edits: now 79.9%, `L=R=61`, `T=52 B=51`. A **dark
rendition** now exports too — `icon.json` always declared one, but the build only ever ran `--rendition Default`, so
the About modal showed a white plate in a dark window. Both assets downscale to 256 (they render at 80px):
**1,324,994 bytes → 102,073 for two**. `Sources/Front.svg`, `Sources/Middle.svg` and `build-icons.sh` were
**untracked** — the editable artwork existed in one working tree with no way to recover it — and are now in the repo.
Separately, five landing favicons were committed as **fully transparent PNGs**, including both PWA manifest icons.

**Homebrew.** #857 (`verified:` deprecation) fixed and pushed to the tap as `551d6eb`; reproduced before and
confirmed silent after, `brew audit --cask --strict` exits 0. #96 was the more serious one — Homebrew 7 refuses
untrusted third-party casks outright, so the documented install path failed at the first command until #95.

**Landed today (PR #102)** — two Linux bugs that compounded each other, both reported by @mrKlar:
- **#94 — AppImage child processes inherited the bundle library path.** linuxdeploy's `AppRun.wrapped` exports
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the bundle's dirs **first** and the caller's original appended, saving **no copy** of the
  original, so there is nothing to restore — the fix must remove. Every spawned child inherited it, so a *host*
  binary resolved the bundle's Ubuntu 22.04 libraries: `git-remote-https` died with `undefined symbol:
  nghttp2_option_set_no_rfc9113_leading_and_trailing_ws_validation`, and catalog setup, Pull and Check-for-updates
  all failed. **Reported as an Arch bug; it is really every host that is not the build host** — reproduced on
  Ubuntu 26.04 aarch64. New `src-tauri/src/util/proc.rs` strips only entries under `$APPDIR`, keeps the host path,
  and no-ops when `$APPDIR` is unset (all of macOS/Windows). Applied at **all three** spawn sites — `run_git` was
  only the visible victim; `probe_version` (tool detection) and `reveal_path` were equally poisoned.
- **#92 — every backend error rendered as `[object Object]`.** Tauri rejects with a serialized `AppError`, a plain
  object, so `String(e)` yields that. New `errorText()` in `types.ts` routes AppError → `appErrorMessage()`,
  Error → `.message`, else → `String`, applied at every user-facing site (9 components, 6 stores). It also cleared
  three places showing a bare code like `io`, and three redundant `isAppError` branches. **This bug is why #94 cost
  its reporter an evening.** Unreadable errors do not just annoy, they hide the next bug.

**Contributor burst (09-09 → 09-11), all unreviewed:** @Musa919 ×4 (#97 docs, #98 dep bumps, #99 Linux AppArmor
release fix, #100 `cargo fmt` the whole backend), @HBBTR #101 Turkish i18n, @el-j #95 trust command (+ #96 brew
cask trust). @mrKlar filed #92/#93/#94 in one sitting — high-quality, mechanism-level reports.

**Open issues clustered by platform** (fix them in one release, not one at a time):
- *Windows*: #65 "installs, runs, window never opens, no error" — our own **#69** (WebView2 bootstrapper, +3 lines)
  is the likely fix and has been sitting since 07-12; #66 Antigravity not detected; #84 terminal flash, fixed by
  @ROTl24's **#85**.
- *Linux*: #94 + #92 done today; #89 WSL2 blank window (CSS/images never render) still open.
- *Features*: #91 Mistral Vibe, #90 Grok, #71 OpenClaw not detecting, #79 count mismatch, #27/#26 skills + Hermes.

**Gates, and their traps.** `npm run check` (svelte-check) is **0 errors on clean `main`** — take a baseline before
blaming your own diff. `cargo test` for the backend. There is **no `lint` and no `test` npm script**. `cargo fmt` is
**not** clean on `main` (that is what #100 is for), so format only files you *add* or your diff drowns in unrelated
churn. A fresh worktree needs `npm ci` before `npm run check` can run. Linux work has a real test bed now: `ssh
scratch`, Ubuntu 26.04 aarch64, passwordless root. Note releases ship an **amd64-only** AppImage, so the shipped
Linux artifact cannot be executed there — reproduce mechanisms instead.

## History — post-v0.3.0 steady state (2026-08-10)

**State (2026-08-10)**: **post-v0.3.0 steady state** — `main` @ `04c10be`. v0.3.0 shipped ~07-05 (Runbooks); since
then contributor merges + polish + i18n, no new release. **Live focus: RTL localization** — Phase 1 is PR #81
(dir switch + titlebar mirror + Settings close), verified live in Persian; Phase 2 (logical-property sweep, ~½ day)
not started. 8 open PRs, all mergeable (#81 RTL, #82 healthcare label, #85, #80, #77, #69, #67, #62). **Read
`NEXT-SESSION.md` (2026-08-10 block) for the full live picture** — it supersedes everything below this line.

## History — v0.2.0 ship state (2026-06-23)

**State**: 🚀 **v0.2.0 SHIPPED (2026-06-23)** — `main` @ `16182e5`. First feature release since the v0.1.0
launch (the internally-tracked "0.1.1"/"0.1.2" milestones were never cut separately — they ship here), and
**auto-update is now LIVE** at [`agencyagents.app/updater.json`](https://agencyagents.app/updater.json) for
**both Mac arches** (`darwin-aarch64` + `darwin-x86_64`). Release at
[releases/tag/v0.2.0](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents-app/releases/tag/v0.2.0): **9 assets** (macOS
aarch64+x64 signed/notarized DMGs **+ updater tarballs**, Linux deb/rpm/AppImage, Windows x64/arm64). Homebrew:
`brew tap msitarzewski/agency-agents && brew install --cask agency-agents` (cask @ 0.2.0). Cross-platform CI in
`.github/workflows/` (linux-build, windows-build) fires on `v*` tags; macOS DMGs build locally via
`scripts/release.sh`. Full ship log: `agentLog.md` 2026-06-23; task doc `tasks/2026-06/260623_v0.2.0-ship.md`.

**Workflow (from 2026-06-16):** ALL changes go through a **branch → PR → merge to `main`**. No direct commits to main.

## ✅ v0.2.0 — first feature release + LIVE auto-update — SHIPPED (2026-06-23, PRs #21 + #22; `main` @ 16182e5)
- **Auto-update is on.** Endpoint `agencyagents.app/updater.json` (Caddy on `umacbookpro` from `~/Sites/agency-agents/`,
  sibling vhost to the live `brew-browser.zerologic.com` manifest). **Dedicated agency signing key `ABF5AFD8`**
  (embedded pubkey in `tauri.conf.json`; private key + password in the **macOS Keychain**, services
  `agency-agents-updater-key` / `…-key-pw`; canonical key file backup at `~/.config/agency-agents-app/updater.key`).
  Live path = check → notify → one-click install; full hands-off auto-install is still deferred (the
  "Install updates automatically" toggle ships **present-but-disabled**).
- **Release build gotchas (now fixed + documented in `BUILD.md` / `release.sh` / PR #22):**
  - Updater-on macOS builds **must pass a `--config`** flag — the macos-private-api allowlist check reads only
    base `tauri.conf.json`, so the split `tauri.macos.conf.json` (`macOSPrivateApi:true`) is invisible to it
    (tauri#11142). `release.sh` now always passes `--config '{"app":{"macOSPrivateApi":true}}'`. (Every old
    `SKIP_UPDATER` build worked only because it happened to pass a `--config`.)
  - **Intel cross-compile needs the rustup toolchain** — Homebrew's `rust` is host-only (`can't find crate for
    core`). Build with `PATH="$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin:$PATH"`.
  - **Store the updater Keychain key via `$(cat …)`**, never a manual paste — a trailing newline corrupts it and
    signing fails with `incorrect updater private key password: Invalid input`.
- **Asset naming uses underscores** (`Agency_Agents_0.2.0_*`), NOT v0.1.0's auto-sanitized dots — the live updater
  manifest and the brew cask url both depend on this.
- **Post-ship UX (PR #23):** the Agents pane now has a **"Needs attention" filter** (= Outdated ∪ Modified ∪
  Missing). The install-state lens moved into nav (`ui.agentsLens`) so the Dashboard "N need attention" stat +
  health-donut segments **deep-link** to a **flat all-divisions** filtered list (`showDivisions` gates on
  `lens === "all"`); cross-launch lens persistence dropped (would hijack the landing).
- Decisions: `decisions.md` 2026-06-22 (host + dedicated key) and 2026-06-23 (build mechanics). Gates: cargo 264/0,
  svelte-check 0, signed+notarized, CI green.

## ✅ v0.1.2 — Tool registry + Osaurus + Playbook + Projects dashboard — SHIPPED (2026-06-21, PRs #18 + #19; `main` @ 1df932c)
**Tool knowledge is now a single source of truth.** It consolidated to the single canonical `tools.json` the
upstream `agency-agents` repo OWNS (twin of `divisions.json`, CI-guarded by its no-jq `check-tools.sh`); both the
Rust backend (`registry.rs`, `include_str!`) and the frontend (`toolRegistry.ts`) read it. **The Rust `Tool` enum
is GONE** — a tool is a string id; `label`/`detect`/`version`/`dests`/`scope` are registry lookups; `render()`
dispatches on the JSON `format` key. Frontend deleted ACCENTS/ICONS_SVG/SHORT/hardcoded SUPPORTED_TOOLS.
**Adding a tool = editing one JSON file** (+ a Rust formatter only for a brand-new output format).
- **All 13 tools** modeled (incl. Kimi, Osaurus); Tools panel shows installable + recognized-only (dimmed). Real
  brand logos (Lobe Icons, MIT) under `assets/tools/`, letter fallback otherwise.
- **Installability derived, not stored:** `installable(tool) = format ∈ IMPLEMENTED_FORMATS` ({identity,
  codex-toml, gemini-md, qwen-md, cursor-mdc, opencode-md, skill-md}). aa owns upstream truth; renderer coverage
  is app-side + self-maintaining (ship a renderer → add its format → those tools light up).
- **Osaurus wired** via a `skill-md` format (Agent-Skills `SKILL.md`, `slugPrefix:"agency-"`), byte-identical to
  upstream `convert_osaurus` — contributed UPSTREAM first (catalog owns transforms), mirrored here (parity test).
  Verified live: catalog agents run as native Osaurus skills.
- **Playbook** (in-app practices + copyable starter prompts + per-team/division examples; title-bar 📖 + ⌘K) +
  `docs/USING-AGENTS.md`. **Teams & Projects master/detail** via the system back arrow
  (`ui.projectsSelected`/`teamsSelected`); **division overview** + deploy.
- **Dashboard**: two-ring Global-vs-Projects install **sunburst** (`InstallSunburst.svelte`) so totals reconcile;
  cross-tool coverage **merged** with catalog-by-division (linked hover); uniform donuts, equal-height cards.

Task doc: [tasks/2026-06/260621_tool-registry-12-tools-osaurus.md](tasks/2026-06/260621_tool-registry-12-tools-osaurus.md).
Green: cargo 264/0, svelte-check 0, build clean. Upstream `agency-agents` (same machine): Osaurus transformer +
`tools.json` + `check-tools.sh` + `check-tools.yml` landed (aa PRs #605/#606).

## ✅ v0.1.1 IA arc — SHIPPED (2026-06-17 → 06-20, PRs #15 + #16, + the deploy-browser PR)
The whole "how people think about agents" reorganization landed:
- **Divisions landing** — the Agents tab opens on divisions; select-mode → bulk deploy.
- **Install-state lens** — filter the agent list by deployment state (In sync / Outdated / Untracked / Missing /
  Not installed), counts scoped to the division.
- **Teams** (renamed from Loadouts) — "Your team" (current installs, division-grouped) + "Team presets"
  (app-bundled `presetTeams.ts` + your saved teams, `teams.svelte.ts`).
- **how × where engine** (backend, PR #15) — tools are dual-scope; `render::dests()` scope-aware;
  `supports_user()`/`supports_project()`; install scope derived from the chosen project. Verified tool-path
  matrix (June 2026) in the PR. Cursor is project-only; Windsurf/Aider/Antigravity/openclaw deferred.
- **Projects pillar** (4th nav section, ⌘4; Activity → ⌘5) — `projects.svelte.ts` store (registered roots in
  localStorage ∪ the live ledger), `Projects.svelte` panel with rosters.
- **One `InstallModal`** — the destinations × tools GRID (rows = Global + each project + "Add project…",
  columns = detected tools, cells = tri-state toggles). Reused by agent detail, divisions, Teams, Projects.
  Replaced `DeployModal` + the inline switch-matrix. Agent detail: "Install…" in the title, pills on their own row.
- **Two-pane `DeployBrowser.svelte`** (Projects "Deploy…") — System-Settings master/detail: left =
  searchable list of EVERY granularity (agents · divisions · teams incl. saved · current roster); right =
  per-project per-tool install.

**Four-pillar model (drives IA copy):** Agents = *who* · Tools = *how* · Teams = *which* · Projects = *where*.

## 🔵 Backlog (next — full list in `docs/PLAN.md` post-0.2.0 punch list)
- **Opt-in automatic install** — the v0.2.0 "Install updates automatically" toggle is inert; wire it to a real
  off-by-default background download → verify → install (live updater is check → notify → one-click install today).
- **Refresh `tools.json` from the catalog clone** (vs. the bundled baseline) — like the corpus + `divisions.json`;
  cleaner now that aa #605 prunes stale convert output.
- **Foreign-sweep for nested skill dirs** (`…/<dir>/SKILL.md`) so CLI-installed Osaurus/Antigravity skills are
  detected (app-installed ones already are).
- **Antigravity wiring** once upstream makes its skill deterministic (drops the non-deterministic `date_added`).
- **"Auto Updates" subscription** for bulk installs — installing all of a division/team into a project/tool
  offers to auto-deploy newly-added catalog agents.
- **Copilot `.md` → `.agent.md`** (needs reconcile `file_stem` double-extension handling).
- Optionally tighten backend `detect()` to require the tool **binary**, not just a lingering config dir.
- Bonus: a "scaffold AGENT-ZERO into a project" action (every assistant honors repo-root `AGENTS.md`).

**Dev-harness note:** to screenshot-verify the Svelte frontend in a browser (the native Tauri window can't be
auto-driven), a `?shim=1` Tauri-IPC shim is temporarily injected into `src/app.html` then reverted — it never
ships. The shim can't open a real native folder dialog (returns a fixture path), so "Add project…" looks broken
in the shim though it works natively.

**Last updated**: 2026-06-23

## ✅ Pre-release polish (2026-06-15) — committed + pushed on `release-planning`
- **brew vestige cleanup**: error-type rename (`BrewError*`→`AppError*`), removed dead `catalogAutoRefresh`
  setting, removed the dead error codes (`brew_*`, `job_not_found`, `canceled`, `feature_disabled`,
  `vulns_not_installed`), and **deleted the brew-era Python pipeline** (`tools/{catalog,categorize,enrich,
  pipeline,trending-collector}` — they fetched Homebrew formulae, NOT used by AA; the catalog comes from
  `corpus/mod.rs`).
- **Activity Journal** (replaces the inherited, permanently-empty brew streaming "Activity"): pivoted
  `activity.svelte.ts` to a `JournalEntry` store (localStorage), `install.svelte.ts` logs every
  install/uninstall/update/track/bulk + default-target switch, `ActivityHistory.svelte` rewritten as a
  day-grouped clearable journal. Deleted `ActivityDrawer.svelte` + `AppStreamEvent`/`ActivityJob` types.
  Built via a Workflow (planner→builder→Code-Reviewer+UX-Architect team→fix loop); UX nits hand-polished.
- **Tools pane lens**: defaults to **Installed** (detected/in-use) tools; toggle `Installed · Not installed
  · All` (top row beside rescan, no count chips). `ToolsView.svelte`. Bar = **catalog coverage**
  (green installed / gray rest), not sync-state.
- **Agents workspace streamlined**: removed the filter lens (per-row install dots already show count);
  Division dropdown moved onto the search row as the first element (neutral form styling); detail pane
  hidden when no agent is selected (list goes full-width).
- **Cold `cargo test` tauri-gate fix**: `.cargo/config.toml` feeds `TAURI_CONFIG` so bare cargo (tests/CI)
  passes the `macos-private-api` allowlist gate (Tauri CLI overrides it for real builds). `macos-private-api`
  enabled in `Cargo.toml`. Verified `tauri dev` still launches clean.
- **Cross-platform creds FIXED + VM-validated**: GitHub token now persists to the OS-native vault per
  platform (Keychain / Credential Manager / Secret Service) via per-target `keyring` features; also moved
  `macos-private-api` to `[target.macos]` only (was wrongly in base deps → broke the Linux gate). Built +
  tested on Ubuntu (258/0 + deb/rpm/appimage) and Windows x64 via `phase-c.sh` VM matrix.
- **Dead-code/brew pass**: removed dead `agentsFilter` lens plumbing; scrubbed ALL brew comment mentions
  (grep → none); zero cargo dead_code warnings.
- **UX**: adaptive Uninstall/Delete wording by ownership; OS-style click-outside menu dismiss; Tools detail
  closes when the lens hides the tool; CoverageMatrix shades by **coverage-%** (not raw size).
- **Terminology**: user-facing **Category → Division** (catalog repo's term); internal `category` field kept.
- **Dashboard viz DONE**: replaced the cross-tool matrix with **CoverageDonuts** (one donut per tool,
  sliced by division, shared legend, linked hover); established a curated **division color scheme** as catalog
  metadata (PR github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents/pull/592 = `divisions.json`) read via `corpus.colorOf`;
  Dashboard "Coverage by tool" click now selects the tool (`ui.openTools`). **`CatalogByDivision.svelte`** (NEW)
  replaces the orange bar-list: ONE proportional bar (segment per division, brand-colored), labels across FOUR
  lanes (2 top, 2 bottom) tied to segments by **non-crossing Z-elbow leaders** (rank-staggered rails +
  phase-shifted bottom columns), plus CoverageDonuts-style **linked hover** (dim others). Division **icons
  tinted** with their color in the `Division ▾` dropdown + persona pill (added `corpus.iconOf`); `categoryIcon.ts`
  gained `Map`+`Workflow` so gis/integrations stop falling back to "?". See `agentLog.md` 2026-06-15 (later 4).
- **Green throughout**: svelte-check 0 errors, cargo 258/0 (macOS + Linux), config validation all-pass.

## ✅ Phase C (2026-06-14) — both red items closed
- **Renderer parity VERIFIED.** `render/mod.rs` mirrors the upstream shell converter byte-for-byte
  (`source_field`/`source_body`/`slugify`/`output_slug`); new `--ignored` test diffs the real
  `scripts/convert.sh` → **232 agents × 5 transform tools = 1160/1160 byte-identical**. The
  `current`/Diff/Update model is now proven, not assumed.
- **Uninstall safety RESOLVED.** `remove_agent_files` backs up modified files FIRST (separate pass),
  byte-identical files need no backup, backup failure aborts the delete (original preserved). Tests cover
  every path.
- **Cross-platform chrome DONE.** Config split: base `tauri.conf.json` (decorations, opaque, no
  macOS-only keys) + `tauri.macos.conf.json` override (overlay titlebar/traffic-light/transparency).
- **Cleanup:** brew→Agency rename finished in `lib.rs`; dead `Settings` fields purged; docs overhauled;
  stale release notes removed; new `tools/phase-c/` validation runner. **Catalog now = 232 agents**
  (the re-org landed). Green: cargo 258/0 + parity 1/0, svelte-check 0, build clean.

## 🟣 Tahoe app icon (read first if touching icons)
macOS 26 renders icons from a compiled **`Assets.car`** (Icon Composer Liquid Glass), NOT `.icns` — `.icns`
-only = blank/gray squircle ("icon jail"). FIXED: `actool` (full Xcode only, by path) compiles
`docs/icon/AppIcon.icon` → `src-tauri/Assets.car` (in `bundle.resources`) + Tahoe-aware
`src-tauri/icons/icon.icns`; `src-tauri/Info.plist` adds `CFBundleIconName=AppIcon` (Tauri merges it).
**Don't run `npm run tauri icon`** (clobbers the glass icns). Full recipe: `docs/icon/README-liquid-glass.md`.
Dev Dock hack REMOVED (lib.rs plain `.run()`, objc2 deps dropped).


## Current state (read NEXT-SESSION.md for the full picture + IMMEDIATE backlog)
- **Phase B + nav + Tools (2026-06-09):** Dashboard has 4 dependency-free charts (`HealthDonut`,
  `CoverageMatrix` category×tool, coverage-by-tool bars, category distribution). **Back/forward nav**
  (titlebar ◀▶, ⌘[/], mouse 3/4) over a `ui` NavLocation history; `agentsCategory`+`agentsSelected`
  lifted into `ui`. **Division pills deep-link** everywhere (`ui.openDivision`); lens counts narrow to
  the division; added "Not installed" lens; zero-count lenses/stats hide. **Tools = list/detail console**
  (`ToolsView` rebuilt): badges (`util/toolBadge`), health bars, versions (`tool_versions`), Reveal
  (`reveal_path`), Default-target Switch, Sync-to-catalog/Track-all/Remove-all, projects list. Dev Dock
  icon set on `RunEvent::Ready` (macOS debug). Icon redrawn as a **macOS squircle** (regenerated).
- **UNIFIED Agents workspace (Phase A done).** Agents + Library are ONE three-pane surface
  (`AgentsWorkspace.svelte`): list pane (filter lens All/Installed/Needs-attention/Untracked + search +
  Category ▾ + Select-mode bulk) · `ResizeHandle` · persistent detail pane (`PersonaBody` + the
  `DeploymentMatrix`). `PersonaDiscover.svelte` + `AgentLibrary.svelte` DELETED.
- **Deployment band under the name/division**: summary pills for installed tools + a "USE WITH ⌄"
  disclosure. User tools = `Switch` (on=installed); project tools = Install/Add-project + per-project
  sub-rows. Drift actions (Diff/Track/Update) inline when applicable. New `Switch.svelte` (shared,
  extracted from Settings→Network), `util/platform.ts` (⌘/Ctrl shortcut glyphs).
- Nav: `library` section retired everywhere; `ui.agentsFilter` + `ui.openAgents(filter)` deep-link
  (Dashboard cards + palette use it). Section id stayed `personas`.
- **Byte-identical foreign → `current`**; **recursive indexing**; `agent_diff` + `DiffModal`; Track (safe).
- Active catalog = **userClone** `/Users/michael/Software/AgentLand/agency-agents` (manage:true).
- **Signed + notarized `.app`/`.dmg`** via `scripts/release.sh` (SKIP_UPDATER=1). 247 Rust tests / 0.
- 🔵 NEXT: **Phase B** = 4 Dashboard charts (coverage matrix · health donut · category distribution ·
  per-tool coverage), dependency-free SVG/CSS, cells deep-link into the workspace. Then **Phase C** =
  Windows/Linux titlebar degradation + "this device" copy + home-path display.
- ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-14: (1) **renderer parity** vs convert.sh — VERIFIED 1160/1160 byte-identical;
  (2) **uninstall safety** — RESOLVED (backup-first for modified, none for byte-identical, abort-on-fail).

## (historical) Earlier this arc
- **Adopt → Track**: destructive Adopt gone. `track_agent` records provenance, writes nothing; every
  write backs up first (`<app_data>/backups/`); `agent_diff` for review-before-Update.
- **categories from tooling**: `discover_categories` parses `AGENT_DIRS` from
  `scripts/convert.sh`. **Data fix: `integrations` (convert.sh output) dropped (210→209); `strategy`
  added.** Removed the orphan `integrations/backend-architect-with-memory.md` from the baseline (it's
  a valid-but-misfiled enrichment example; to ship it for real, promote it UPSTREAM into a real
  category — then it flows in via refresh).
- **#1 slices 2–4 — catalog source**: `CatalogSource` (Bundled | Managed{~/.agency-agents} |
  UserClone{path,manage}) in `state/catalog.json`; corpus reads/writes the RESOLVED root. Detect
  (~/.agency-agents + "Find" scan), provision (git clone or snapshot), pull (git pull or tarball).
  First-run picker (`CatalogFirstRun`) + `Settings → Catalog`. Verbs Track/Update, manage-with-
  permission, picker+Find — all as decided. cargo test 275/0; svelte-check 0 err; build green.
- ⚠️ NOTE: existing installs (incl. Michael's) have no catalog.json → the **first-run picker WILL
  appear** on next launch (by design — one-time source choice; pick "Bundled" to keep current).

> Full plan + sequence: `phases/phase-roadmap.md` (the "v2" block). Detailed resume notes +
> gotchas: `NEXT-SESSION.md`. Build spec: `contracts.md`. Architecture: `systemPatterns.md`.

## How to run (dev)
- `npm run tauri dev` from repo root. **Dev server is on port 1430** (NOT 1420 — that's
  brew-browser; sharing it makes one app load the other's frontend). HMR for frontend; Rust changes
  recompile. The app opens on **Agents** (personas).
- Reference clones (read-only): `/tmp/brew-browser-inspect`, `/tmp/agency-agents-inspect`.

## What works (verified)
- **Agents** catalog (210 agents / 16 categories), search, persona detail with an **Install** menu.
- **Library** — flat list of installs; your ~184 `install.sh` agents show as `foreign` with Adopt.
- **Tools**, **Loadouts** (Agentfile), **Dashboard** (agency rollup), Activity, Settings (⌘,).
- Backend: `corpus · render · install · github · util · commands{github,settings,updater}`.
  `cargo test` ~265/0; `vite build` + `svelte-check` green; app boots clean (210 corpus seeded).
- New brain-circuit **app icon** (dark shipped; light master in `docs/icon/`). About window rebranded.

## Immediate next: Michael runs it, then #2 / #3
**#1 slices 1–4 ✅ done.** Remaining for #1 (deferred refinements, non-blocking):
- `aliases.json` (slug renames across catalog versions) — not yet honored.
- Explicit **orphan** surfacing (ledger rows whose slug left the catalog) + unique-slug enforcement.
- `.agency-cache/` convention + add to the agency-agents repo `.gitignore` (cache not yet written).
- Symlink-aware reconcile (the `~/.claude` alias case) — still the old behavior.

Then: **#2 Track-all / Update-all**; **#3 tool-grouped Library IA** (L1 tools+counts → L2 per-tool)
+ wire `agent_diff` into a review-before-Update UI.

## Decisions locked (this session)
- Build order: **Both, Track first** → Track DONE, now #1.
- Clone detection: **picker-primary + a "Find Agency Agents" button** (opt-in scan, not auto).
- Existing clone: **manage-with-permission**. Managed path: **`~/.agency-agents`**.
- Cache dir: `.agency-cache/`. Verbs: **Track / Update**.
- Categories: **parse from repo tooling** (`AGENT_DIRS` in convert.sh), not a frontmatter heuristic.

## ✅ RESOLVED: "Adopt" is no longer unsafe
Adopt → **Track** (non-destructive) + backup-on-write shipped this session. The old clobber path is
gone.
